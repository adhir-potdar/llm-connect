### 1. **MongoDB**
   - **Description**: MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases and is specifically designed for storing JSON-like documents. It uses a binary JSON (BSON) format for storage, which is efficient for querying and indexing.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Flexible schema: Documents can have varying structures.
     - Rich query language: Supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation.
     - Horizontal scaling: Supports sharding for distributing data across multiple servers.
     - High availability: Replica sets provide redundancy and automatic failover.

### 2. **Couchbase**
   - **Description**: Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL database that combines the flexibility of JSON document storage with the performance of a key-value store.
   - **Key Features**:
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - Full-text search: Integrated with Couchbase N1QL for querying.
     - Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling and automatic data distribution.
     - High performance: Optimized for low-latency access and high throughput.

### 3. **Amazon DynamoDB**
   - **Description**: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports both key-value and document data models.
   - **Key Features**:
     - JSON document storage: Documents can be stored as JSON.
     - Serverless: Automatically scales with your application.
     - High availability: Built-in redundancy and automatic failover.
     - Integration: Deep integration with other AWS services.

### 4. **Apache Cassandra**
   - **Description**: Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database known for its high availability and scalability. While it is primarily a column-family store, it can be used to store JSON documents.
   - **Key Features**:
     - High availability: No single point of failure.
     - Scalability: Supports linear scalability.
     - Flexible schema: Columns can be added dynamically.
     - JSON support: Can store JSON documents using libraries like `json-simple` or `Jackson`.

### 5. **Elasticsearch**
   - **Description**: Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that is often used for full-text search and analytics. It stores data in JSON format.
   - **Key Features**:
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - Full-text search: Optimized for search and analytics.
     - Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling.
     - Real-time analytics: Provides near real-time search and analytics capabilities.

### 6. **Firebase Realtime Database**
   - **Description**: Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that includes a real-time NoSQL database. It stores data as JSON.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Real-time updates: Data is synchronized in real-time across clients.
     - Offline support: Data is cached locally for offline use.
     - Scalability: Automatically scales with your application.
     - Integration: Deep integration with other Firebase services.

### 7. **RethinkDB**
   - **Description**: RethinkDB is a NoSQL database that is designed to make it easy to build real-time applications. It stores data in JSON format.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Real-time updates: Supports real-time data push.
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - Query language: Uses ReQL, a powerful query language.
     - Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling.

### 8. **CouchDB**
   - **Description**: CouchDB is an open-source NoSQL database that stores data in JSON format. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
   - **Key Features**:
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - RESTful API: Access and manage data via HTTP.
     - Replication: Supports multi-master replication for high availability.
     - MapReduce views: Supports querying and indexing using MapReduce.

### 9. **ArangoDB**
   - **Description**: ArangoDB is a multi-model NoSQL database that supports document, key-value, and graph data models. It stores documents in JSON format.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Multi-model: Supports documents, key-value, and graph data models.
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - AQL (ArangoDB Query Language): A powerful query language for complex queries.
     - Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling.

### 10. **Azure Cosmos DB**
   - **Description**: Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by Microsoft. It supports multiple APIs, including a document API that stores data in JSON format.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Multi-model: Supports document, key-value, graph, and column-family data models.
     - JSON document storage: Documents are stored in JSON format.
     - Global distribution: Automatically replicates data across multiple regions.
     - Consistency levels: Offers tunable consistency levels.

### Summary
Each of these NoSQL databases has its own strengths and is suited to different use cases. MongoDB and Couchbase are often the go-to choices for general-purpose JSON document storage, while others like Elasticsearch and DynamoDB are better suited for specific needs like search or cloud-native applications.
